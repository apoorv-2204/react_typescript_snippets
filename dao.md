## DAO

### 
- decentralised => Running On Blockchain
- Autonomus => smart contracts
- prganisation => group of people sharing same goal

#### Traditional Organization Coporation
- tree heirarichy
- chairmain top of heirarchy 
- CEO impl major decision
-  Under CEO D1,D2,D3,D4 (director of department)
-  under director (m1, m2, m3, m4) (managers)
-  under mangager (employee, intern,e2,i2) not involded in decision making

CEO => takes major decision
D1=> takes second to major decison
---
===
- tree heirarichy, decison at top
- changes made by sole party, single person, who has authority
- centralised control
- if voting is allowed, votes are talled internally, outcome is handled manually 
- decison making is private
### DAO Flat Heirarichy 
- everyone has same power
- same level of heirarichy
- everyone has same voting power
- decision on votes
(but votes can be bought like in politics. - Anonymous voting dao,But i Can buy the person who has the token, but what happens outside the blockchain it can influence)
- SC tally the votes on its own, tamper proof(but who votes can be tampered,)
- delegated voting
- IN DAo anyone can propose a new idea ,and others can vote 
- DAo has a vote threshold.
-  like polkadot auctions
-  Discouraging people from spamming idea easily, we have proposal mechanism
-  idea < 300 votes gets ahead with proposal
-  idea > 300 , good idea, if it is above 300 and then it can be proposed
- its no xconsenus, but we need consensus, like in multisig wallet if it reaches a certain threshold
- Blockchain/sc based values run the organisation=> transparanetly and on chain
  
---
===
-flat, completely democratic 
- voting is mandaorily by members to implement changes(avoid decision by one person)
- completly decentralised
- Compulsory voting, transparent calculating, transparent decison imp(who ensure decison is carried out)
- decison making is public and transparent and verifiable on blockchain
- 

### Why we need DAo
-  to start an organization we need funding
-  lot of trust in the people you are working with(on internet building a organization,we cant trust people)
- DAO is an application, helps building company in blockchain
- makes sense when huge community members are involved

### exmples
- collective ownership
- charity
- purchase and buy a physicall/digital asset, by voters/members 
- Venture & grants => vote for fund allocation for a purpose
- profits are distributed as reward holders
- upgradable contacts
- ICO implemented via dao
- uniswap v3 , v1,v2 


### upgradable contract cant remove functionaly but can add new functionality self dsertuct contracts 

## Dao GOvernance
- mechanism of how voting and proposal work
1) delegation based mechanism
    - token holders/votes
    - delegated votes, weight votes 
    - delegation gives votes to another account, who can have weight on amount of delgated votes the account have
    - parliamentary structure MP=> people vote for mp
    - mp vote for Prime minister
    - combination of singular voting and delegated voting
1) Automatic transaciton governance
    - quorum of people gives positive upvotes(%tage threshold of upvotes)
    - Threshold based mechanism
3) Multisignature Governance 
    - instead of funds/idea/proposal/
    - 50/70 or 80/100 to expand the idea
    - we can have both number and signature
    -  we can impl a minimal dao with multi sig wallet
    -  we need proposal struct

    -  at least a  total min percentage of vote is required
    -  30 upvotes 20 down votes min 
    -  Min voting percentage and min upvotes for approval?
    -  we cand o it for each proposal? no   
    -  hardcode the minimun requirement


#### we can have combination of impl of this dao
#### time lock functionality  Time interval => collect votes. tally votes if certaain time has elapsed
